CBB.cpp and IP.cpp contain the source codes for the CBB and the LBC algorithms described in the paper, respectively. The corresponding “cpp” file needs to be compiled using a C++ compiler (such as Visual Studio). Note that we include "gurobi_c++.h" in "IP.cpp" file. The LBC algorithm uses Gurobi solver, which can be downloaded and installed from Gurobi's official website [The Leader in Decision Intelligence Technology - Gurobi Optimization](https://www.gurobi.com/). File "gurobi_c++.h" will be automatically installed and it needs to be added to the project before compiling (specific process of this step depends on the compiling software). Then, the generated executable file, network files, and a text file titled “filename.txt” containing the filenames of networks need to be included in the same folder in order to run the algorithm.
